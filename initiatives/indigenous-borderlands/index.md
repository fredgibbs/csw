# Indigenous Borderlands in North America Symposium  
Date: Wednesday, November 2 - Saturday, November 5, 2022
Location: National Hispanic Cultural Center, Albuquerque, New Mexico

This symposium seeks to develop new borderland and border-crossing approaches to continental North America that center Indigenous peoples, homelands, political concerns, and related dynamics â€“ temporally and spatially expanding borderlands frameworks.

# Academics and Community Members Together
Bringing historians in strategic conversation with scholars of other disciplines and with Indigenous community members, we ask how cross-disciplinary and community-facing dialogue can advance humanistic knowledge, developing new ways to envision borders, crossings, histories, and futures in contexts of social and environmental change.

# First in a Series
This launches a series of international conferences on Indigenous borderlands in American and global contexts.

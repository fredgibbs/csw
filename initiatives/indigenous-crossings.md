# Indigenous Crossings Workshop 
Date: September 26-27, 2022

Location: Taos, New Mexico

We live in a world of seemingly unprecedented motion. As climate change, political struggles, and ethnic cleansing propel humans and their other-than-human kin across borders in new ways, we find ourselves stymied by a failure of historical imagination. Historians joined others for generations in seeing the past as prologue to a state- and settler-centered modernity, a world increasingly (some might say inevitably) fixed in place by the enclosure, erasure, and transformation of Indigenous and nonstate spaces. This way of framing past, present, and future has created blind spots, especially now that our assumptions of a clearly-demarcated, state-centered future are being tested.

How might Indigenous history speak to our current age of global change? How might we recover a larger global “archive” tied to a deeper, Native-centered past of human and non-human mobility and border crossings? For centuries, peoples, plants, animals, germs, ideas, and objects have moved across land and sea. These deeper histories offer stories that defy nation-state borders and binary framings of human identity, and reveal relations of connection and exchange that have been long obscured by nation-state-centered histories. What can these histories, particularly those grounded in an Indigenous long durée, tell us about exchanges, relationships, and innovations across global borderlands and geographies? And how can Indigenous-centered patterns of migration, sanctuary, and colonization across the globe speak to (indeed, help us reframe) our historical approach to homelands, borderlands, crossings, and identities in ways that will matter to future generations?

In a workshop hosted by the Clements Center for Southwest Studies at SMU in Taos, NM (September 26-27, 2025), we propose anchoring visions of past and future to a deeper planetary archive, one linked to Native nations and Indigenous communities and their historical border crossings world-wide. We seek to connect exciting new work in global Indigenous studies with Native-centered work on place, mobility, climate change and justice, human and other-than-human kinship, migration and sanctuary, borderlands and border crossings, Native trans-national relationships and social movements, and Indigenous politics, identities, diplomacy, and cross-community relations in historical contexts of global change.

This workshop will result in an edited volume of essays. Paper abstracts of around 350 words and a two-page CV or resume should be submitted by March 1, 2025 to cntrsw@unm.edu. Abstracts will be reviewed and all participants notified by late March. Accepted papers of 7,000-10,000 words should be submitted by August 15, 2025 and will be distributed in advance to symposium participants. Travel and accommodation support will be made available.
